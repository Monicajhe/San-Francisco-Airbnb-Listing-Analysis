**Scenario:**

Assuming I have additional cash that I'd like to invest in another property in San Francisco as a vacation house and list the house on Airbnb when not in use. As an inspiring data analyst, I want to do my own research before seeking advice from a real estate agent. 

**Issues/Hypotheses to Explore:**
- Trend in number of listings and price over the year.
- What is the most common room type? How should I list my new vacation house to maximize my profit? How is Airbnb compared to Traditional Renting?
- What's the percentage of single listing hosts? How do they list their property?
- Which neighbourhood can offer me high return and being safe ?
- What are the most common words used in listing names? I can use them as a reference when listing my own house.
